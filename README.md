# eclipse themes - darker

## Introduction
A dark theme for Eclipse 4.2+.

It intends to provide the experience like shown in the IDEA 12's darcula theme(experhttp://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/darcula-1.png) experimentally.

NOTE: I have not enough bandwith now to add a full-fledged configuration for it. I am only planning to add fixings and a little tweakings to types of file(like .txt, soon) to mock darcula' color theme. However, this plugin is easy to modify. I suggest you modify the color string in the sources directly, then enable it by [building it for yourself](https://github.com/jinmingjian/eclipse.themes.darker/wiki/How-to-Build-a-Local-Update-site-for-Consuming-Your-Own-modifications).
